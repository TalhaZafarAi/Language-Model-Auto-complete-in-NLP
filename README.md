# Language Model Auto-Complete (Natural Language Processing)

Embark on a journey of Natural Language Processing with our Language Model Auto-Complete project. Explore, preprocess, and model text data to uncover trends, patterns, and word suggestions. Decode the language for valuable insights!

## Language Model Auto-Complete with NLP

Language Model Auto-Complete with NLP is a project that delves into the world of text data, uncovering trends, patterns, and word suggestions. With our NLP techniques, we explore, clean, and preprocess the data, decoding the language to extract valuable insights for informed decision-making.

## Features

- Utilizes Python and NLP libraries for text data analysis
- Explores trends, patterns, and word suggestions in text data
- Cleans and preprocesses text data for analysis
- Implements n-gram language models
- Provides context-based word suggestions
- Evaluates language model performance using perplexity metrics

## Requirements

- Python 3
- NLTK
- sklearn
- Google Colab (optional for collaborative development)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/language-model-auto-complete.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

Make sure you have Jupyter Notebook installed. If not, you can install it using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install jupyterlab
   ```

Start the Jupyter Notebook server by running the following command in your terminal:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

This will open a new tab in your web browser showing the Jupyter Notebook dashboard. Navigate to the location of your `NLP_Project.ipynb` file and click on it to open it.

You can now run the code cells in the notebook by pressing Shift + Enter.

If you specifically want to run the code in the notebook using Python outside of Jupyter Notebook, you can convert the notebook to a Python script using the following command:

```bash
jupyter nbconvert --to script NLP_Project.ipynb
```

This will create a `.py` file that you can then run using the `python` command. However, note that some functionalities of Jupyter Notebook, such as interactive widgets, may not work in a regular Python script.

3. Run the application:

   ```bash
   python NLP_Project.py
   ```

## Usage

1. Launch the application.
2. Explore trends, patterns, and word suggestions in the text data.
3. Clean and preprocess the text data for analysis.
4. Generate n-gram language models and evaluate their performance using perplexity metrics.
5. Use the word suggestion module to generate context-based word suggestions.
6. Extract valuable insights for informed decision-making.
